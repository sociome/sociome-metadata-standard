# Sociome Metadata Standard
Social determinants of health are the various economic, social, and environmental factors that influence a person's health status. These factors include income, education, employment, housing, and access to healthcare, as well as racism, discrimination, and other forms of social inequality. The conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age all contribute to their overall health and well-being. Social determinants of health have a significant impact on health outcomes, and addressing them is crucial to promoting health equity and reducing health disparities among different populations.
The sociome project seeks to create a sustainable data commons for researchers at UChicago and other institutions to study social determinants of health. 

This package define the data documentation standard used by the sociome project. The documentation is written in a markup language and can be compiled to a different databases and ORM frameworks. Interested parties can extend this repository to extend or refine our standard.
